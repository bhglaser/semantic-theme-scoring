Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting the consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows of our Company as of and for the periods presented below. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. This discussion contains forward looking statements that are based on the beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions made by, and information currently available to, our management. Actual results could differ materially from those discussed in or implied by forward looking statements as a result of various factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, particularly in the section entitled "Risk Factors." Overview Torrid is a direct to consumer brand of apparel, intimates and accessories in North America, targeting the 25 to 40 year old woman who wears sizes 10 to 30. Torrid is focused on fit and offers high quality products across a broad assortment that includes tops, bottoms, denim, dresses, intimates, activewear, footwear and accessories. Our proprietary product offering delivers a superior fit for the curvy woman that makes her love the way she looks and feels. Our style is unapologetically youthful and sexy. We believe our customer values the appeal and versatility of our curated product assortment that helps her look her best for any occasion, including weekend, casual, work and dressy, all at accessible price points. Through our product and brand experience we connect with customers in a way that other brands, many of which treat plus size customers as an after thought, have not. Key Financial and Operating Metrics We use the following metrics to assess the progress of our business, inform how we allocate our time and capital, and assess the near term and longer term performance of our business. Fiscal Year Ended (in thousands, except net sales per active customer, number of stores and percentages) January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 January 30, 2021 Active customers (as of end of period) (A) 3,902 3,821 3,182 Net sales per active customer (A) $ 330 $ 340 $ 309 Comparable sales (B) (3) % 31 % (7) % Number of stores (as of end of period) 639 624 608 Net income (loss) $ 50,209 $ (29,944) $ 24,532 Adjusted EBITDA (C) $ 152,350 $ 245,853 $ 100,797 (A) Active customers and net sales per active customer calculated on a preceding four quarters basis. (B) The computation of comparable sales includes results from stores that were temporarily closed due to COVID 19. (C) Please refer to "Results of Operations" for a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA. Active Customers. We define an active customer as a distinct, identifiable customer who has completed at least one purchase transaction either in store or online in the preceding four quarters. We are able to identify the vast majority of our customers primarily through our robust loyalty program, which gives us access to extensive customer and sales data. We have improved our customer tracking capabilities and have grown the proportion of our net sales attributable to active customers over time. The proportion of net sales, excluding PLCC Funds (as defined in Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies), that we are able to attribute to active customers was 97% for fiscal year 2022, 97% for fiscal year 2021 and 98% for fiscal year 2020. As a result, historical year over year growth in active customers may factor in increases attributable to our improved capabilities. We view the number of active customers as a key indicator of our growth, the reach of our e Commerce and stores platform, the value proposition and consumer awareness of our brand and our customers desire to purchase our products. Net Sales per Active Customer. We define net sales per active customer for any given period as the net sales in the preceding four quarters, divided by the total number of active customers at the end of that period. We view net sales per active customer as a key indicator of our customers purchasing patterns, including their initial and repeat purchase behavior and intend to closely monitor this metric going forward. 31 Comparable Sales. We define comparable sales for any given period as the sales of our e Commerce operations and stores that we have included in our comparable sales base during that period. We include a store in our comparable sales base after it has been open for 15 full fiscal months. If a store is closed during a fiscal year, it is only included in the computation of comparable sales for the full fiscal months in which it was open. The computation of comparable sales includes results from stores that were temporarily closed due to COVID 19. Partial fiscal months are excluded from the computation of comparable sales. Comparable sales allow us to evaluate how our unified commerce business is performing exclusive of the effects of new store openings. We apply current year foreign currency exchange rates to both current year and prior year comparable sales to remove the impact of foreign currency fluctuation and achieve a consistent basis for comparison. Comparable sales allow us to evaluate how our unified commerce business is performing exclusive of the effects of non comparable sales. Number of Stores . Store count reflects all stores open at the end of a reporting period. In connection with opening new stores, we incur pre opening costs, which primarily consist of payroll, travel, training, marketing, initial opening supplies, costs of transporting initial inventory and fixtures to store locations, and occupancy costs incurred from the time of possession of a store site to the opening of that store. These pre opening costs are included in our selling, general and administrative expenses and are expensed as incurred. Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is a supplemental measure of our operating performance that is neither required by, nor presented in accordance with GAAP and our calculation thereof may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Adjusted EBITDA represents GAAP net income (loss) plus interest expense less interest income, net of other expense (income), plus provision for less (benefit from) income taxes, depreciation and amortization ("EBITDA"), and share based compensation, noncash deductions and charges and other expenses. We believe Adjusted EBITDA facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period by isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to ongoing operating performance. We also use Adjusted EBITDA as one of the primary methods for planning and forecasting the overall expected performance of our business and for evaluating on a quarterly and annual basis actual results against such expectations. Further, we recognize Adjusted EBITDA as a commonly used measure in determining business value and, as such, use it internally to report and analyze our results and as a benchmark to determine certain non equity incentive payments made to executives. Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool. This measure is not a measurement of our financial performance under GAAP and should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to or substitutes for net income (loss), income (loss) from operations or any other performance measures determined in accordance with GAAP or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Our presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or non recurring items. Among other limitations, Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect: interest expense; interest income, net of other expense (income); provision for income taxes; depreciation and amortization; share based compensation; noncash deductions and charges; and other expenses. Material Events and Uncertainties Affecting Our Performance We believe that our performance and future success depend on a number of factors that present significant opportunities for us but also pose risks and challenges, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K in the section titled "Risk Factors." Customer Acquisition and Retention. Our success is impacted not only by efficient and profitable customer acquisition, but also by our ability to retain customers and encourage repeat purchases. It is important to maintain reasonable costs for these marketing efforts relative to the net sales and profit we expect to derive from customers. Failure to effectively attract customers on a cost efficient basis would adversely impact our profitability and operating results. New requirements for consumer disclosures regarding privacy practices, and new application tracking transparency framework that requires opt in consent for certain types of tracking were implemented by third party providers in 2021, which has increased the difficulty and cost of acquiring and retaining customers. These changes may adversely affect our results of operations. 32 Customer Migration from Single to Omni channel. We have a history of converting customers from single channel customers to omni channel customers, defined as active customers who shopped both online and in store within the last twelve months. Customers that shop across multiple channels purchase from us more frequently and spent approximately 3.4 times more per year than our single channel customer. Overall Economic Trends. Our results of operations during any given period are often impacted by the overall economic conditions in the markets in which we operate. Consumer purchases of clothing generally remain constant or may increase during stable economic periods and decline during recessionary periods, inflationary periods and other periods when disposable income is adversely affected. Recent historic high rates of inflation have led to a softening of consumer demand. We have encountered inflation on our wages, transportation and product costs, and a material increase in these costs without any meaningful offsetting price increases may reduce our future profits. Additionally, the COVID 19 pandemic may continue to have a materially adverse impact on the macroeconomic environment in the United States as well as our results of operations. Demographic Changes. Our business has experienced growth over recent periods due, in part, to an increase in the plus size population. Slower or negative growth in this demographic, in particular among women ages 25 to 40, specific to certain geographic markets, income levels or overall, could adversely affect our results of operations. Growth in Brand Awareness. We intend to continue investing in our brand, with a specific focus on growing brand awareness, customer engagement, and conversion through targeted investments in performance and brand marketing. We have made significant historical investments to strengthen the Torrid brand through our marketing efforts, brand partnerships, events and expansion of our social media presence. If we fail to cost effectively promote our brand or convert impressions into new customers, our net sales growth and profitability may be adversely affected. Inventory Management. Our strategy is built around a base of core products that provide our customer with year round style. At the same time, we introduce new lines of merchandise approximately 16 times per year, thus providing a consistent flow of fresh merchandise to keep our customer engaged, encourage repeat business and attract new customers. We employ a data driven approach to design and product development, proactively and quickly incorporating sales and operational performance information alongside customer feedback from thousands of product reviews. We engage in ongoing dialogue with customers through social media and customer surveys. Shifts in inventory levels may result in fluctuations in the amount of regular price sales, markdowns, and merchandise mix, as well as gross margin. Impact of COVID 19 . The COVID 19 pandemic has caused general business disruption worldwide. The full extent to which the COVID 19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition will depend on future developments that are uncertain. A resurgence in the pandemic or the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus could have a negative impact on our business including, but not limited to, new closure requirements with respect to some or all of our physical locations, changes in consumer behavior, difficulties attracting and retaining employees and supply chain disruptions. Investments. We have invested significantly to strengthen our business, including augmenting leadership across our organization and enhancing our infrastructure and technology, and have delivered significant growth as a result. In order to realize such growth, we anticipate that our operating expenses will grow as we continue to increase our spending on advertising and marketing and hire additional personnel primarily in marketing, product design and development, merchandising, technology, operations, customer service and general and administrative functions. We will also continue to selectively expand our store footprint and make investments to improve the customer experience both in store and online. We believe that such investments will increase the number and loyalty of our customers and, as a result, yield positive financial performance in the long term. Seasonality. While seasonality frequently impacts businesses in the retail sector, our business is generally not seasonal. Accordingly, our net sales do not fluctuate as significantly as those of other brands and retailers from quarter to quarter and any modest seasonal effect does not significantly change the underlying trends in our business. Additionally, we do not generate an outsized share of our net sales or Adjusted EBITDA during the holiday season. Typically, our Adjusted EBITDA generation is strongest in the first half of the year as we benefit from more favorable merchandise margins, lower advertising and lower shipping expenses relative to the second half of the year. The lack of net sales seasonality provides structural cost advantages relative to peers, including reduced staffing cyclicality and seasonal distribution capacity needs. Components of Our Results of Operations In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made a voluntary change in our accounting policy regarding the classification of PLCC Funds (as defined in Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) we receive pursuant to the Credit Card 33 Agreement (as defined in Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). Historically, we recorded PLCC Funds (as defined in Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Under the new policy, we record PLCC Funds (as defined in Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). This reclassification does not have any impact on income from operations, income before provision for income taxes, net income (loss) or earnings (loss) per share and there was no cumulative effect to stockholders deficit or net assets. The recognition of PLCC Funds (as defined in Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) in net sales is preferable because it will enhance the comparability of our financial statements with those of many of our industry peers and provide greater transparency into performance metrics relevant to our industry by showing the gross impact of the funds received as net sales instead of as a reduction to selling, general and administrative expenses. Net Sales. Net sales reflects our revenues from the sale of our merchandise, shipping and handling revenue received from e Commerce sales, PLCC Funds (as defined in Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) and gift card breakage income, less returns, discounts and loyalty points/awards. Revenue from our stores is recognized at the time of sale and revenue from our e Commerce channel is recognized upon shipment of the merchandise to the home of the customer; except in cases where the merchandise is shipped to a store and revenue is recognized when the customer retrieves the merchandise from the store. Net sales are impacted by the size of our active customer base, product assortment and availability, marketing and promotional activities and the spending habits of our customers. Net sales are also impacted by the migration of single channel customers (i.e., customers shopping only in store or online) to omni channel customers (i.e., customers shopping both in store and online), who on average spend significantly more than single channel customers in a given year. Gross Profit. Gross profit is equal to our net sales less cost of goods sold. Our cost of goods sold includes merchandise costs, freight, inventory shrinkage, payroll expenses associated with the merchandising department, distribution center expenses and store occupancy expenses, including rent, common area maintenance charges, real estate taxes and depreciation. Merchandising payroll costs and store occupancy costs included within cost of goods sold are largely fixed and do not necessarily increase as volume increases. We review our inventory levels on an ongoing basis in order to identify slow moving merchandise and generally use markdowns to clear that merchandise. The timing and level of markdowns are driven primarily by customer acceptance of our merchandise. The primary drivers of our merchandise costs include the raw materials, labor in the countries where we source our merchandise, customs duties, and logistics costs. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses include all operating costs not included in cost of goods sold or marketing expenses. Our historical revenue growth has been accompanied by increased selling, general and administrative expenses. For instance, we continue to make payroll investments to support our long term growth. Marketing Expenses. We continue to make investments in marketing in an effort to grow and retain our active customer base and increase our brand awareness. Marketing expenses consist primarily of (i) targeted online performance marketing costs, such as retargeting, paid search/product listing advertising, and social media advertisements, (ii) store and brand marketing, public relations and photographic production designed to acquire, retain and remain connected to customers and (iii) payroll and benefits expenses associated with our marketing team. Interest Expense. Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense and other fees associated with our Existing ABL Facility, as amended and New Term Loan Credit Agreement. Provision for Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes consists of an estimate of federal and state income taxes based on enacted federal and state tax rates, as adjusted for allowable credits, deductions and uncertain tax positions. 34 Results of Operations Fiscal Year 2022 Compared to Fiscal Year 2021 The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2023 % of Net Sales January 29, 2022 % of Net Sales Net sales (A) $ 1,288,144 100.0 % $ 1,297,271 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 828,605 64.3 % 759,826 58.6 % Gross profit 459,539 35.7 % 537,445 41.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (A) 297,973 23.1 % 439,409 33.8 % Marketing expenses 59,941 4.7 % 52,654 4.1 % Income from operations 101,625 7.9 % 45,382 3.5 % Interest expense 29,736 2.3 % 29,497 2.3 % Interest income, net of other expense 207 0.0 % 56 0.0 % Income before provision for income taxes 71,682 5.6 % 15,829 1.2 % Provision for income taxes 21,473 1.7 % 45,773 3.5 % Net income (loss) $ 50,209 3.9 % $ (29,944) (2.3) % (A) In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made a voluntary change in our accounting policy regarding the classification of PLCC Funds (as defined in "Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies") in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The reclassification is applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. See "Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" for further information. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA for the periods presented (dollars in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 Net income (loss) $ 50,209 $ (29,944) Interest expense 29,736 29,497 Interest income, net of other expense 207 56 Provision for income taxes 21,473 45,773 Depreciation and amortization (A) 36,074 35,204 Share based compensation (B) 9,980 159,754 Noncash deductions and charges (C) 2,493 615 Other expenses (D) 2,178 4,898 Adjusted EBITDA $ 152,350 $ 245,853 (A) Depreciation and amortization excludes amortization of debt issuance costs and original issue discount that are reflected in interest expense. (B) Prior to the consummation of our IPO on July 6, 2021, share based compensation was determined based on the remeasurement of our liability classified incentive units. (C) Noncash deductions and charges includes losses on property and equipment disposals and the net impact of noncash rent expense. (D) Other expenses include IPO related transaction fees, severance costs for certain key management positions and the reimbursement of certain management expenses, primarily for travel, incurred by Sycamore on our behalf, which are not considered to be part of our core business. Net Sales Net sales for fiscal year 2022 decreased $9.2 million, or 0.7%, to $1,288.1 million, from $1,297.3 million for fiscal year 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in average sales transaction value relative to fiscal year 2021, as a result of increased promotional activity, partially offset by a $15.5 million increase in PLCC Funds (as defined in Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). Active customers increased 0.1 million, or 2.1%, to 3.9 million at the end of fiscal year 2022, from 3.8 million at the end of fiscal year 2021. Net sales per active customer decreased by $10 from $340 in fiscal year 2021 to $330 in fiscal year 2022. Comparable sales decreased 3.0%. The total number of stores we operate increased by 15 35 stores, or 2.4%, to 639 stores at the end of fiscal year 2022, from 624 stores at the end of fiscal year 2021. Our new store openings during fiscal year 2022 include an eight location test concept of our intimates brand, Curve. Gross Profit Gross profit for fiscal year 2022 decreased $77.9 million, or 14.5%, to $459.5 million, from $537.4 million for fiscal year 2021. This decrease was primarily due to increases in discounts and promotions related to inventory clearance activity, and product and transportation costs, primarily as a result of inflation. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased 5.7% to 35.7% in fiscal year 2022 from 41.4% in fiscal year 2021. This decrease was primarily driven by increases in discounts and promotions related to inventory clearance activity, product costs and e Commerce shipping costs. The increases in product and e Commerce shipping costs were primarily as a result of inflation. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2022 decreased $141.4 million, or 32.2%, to $298.0 million, from $439.4 million for fiscal year 2021. The decrease was primarily due to a $149.8 million decrease in share based compensation expense and a $19.4 million decrease in performance bonuses, partially offset by increases in store and e Commerce payroll costs of $16.6 million, primarily due to inflationary pressures, headquarters general and administrative expenses of $6.8 million and other store operating costs of $3.4 million. The decrease in share based compensation expense during fiscal year 2022 was due to an increase in the Torrid Holding LLC equity value during fiscal year 2021. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 10.7% to 23.1% in fiscal year 2022 from 33.8% in fiscal year 2021. This decrease was driven by decreased share based compensation expense and performance bonuses, partially offset by increases in store and e Commerce payroll costs, primarily due to inflationary pressures, and other store operating costs. Marketing Expenses Marketing expenses for fiscal year 2022 increased $7.3 million, or 13.8%, to $59.9 million, from $52.7 million for fiscal year 2021. This increase was primarily due to increased television and digital marketing, partially offset by decreased direct mail program spend. Marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales increased by 0.6% to 4.7% in fiscal year 2022 from 4.1% in fiscal year 2021. This increase was primarily driven by increased television and digital marketing. Interest Expense Interest expense was $29.7 million for fiscal year 2022, compared to $29.5 million for fiscal year 2021. The increase was primarily due an increase in the variable interest rate associated with the New Term Loan Credit Agreement and an increase in borrowings on the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, during fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal year 2021, partially offset by the absence of the write off of $5.2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and OID when we repaid the amended term loan credit agreement ("Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement"), and the absence of the $2.1 million prepayment penalty. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2022 decreased by $24.3 million to $21.5 million, from $45.8 million for fiscal year 2021. Our effective tax rate was 30.0% for fiscal year 2022 as compared to 289.2% for fiscal year 2021. The unconventional effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 was primarily due to the increase in the amount of non deductible items associated with share based compensation, relative to income before provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2021. The increase in the amount of non deductible items associated with share based compensation during fiscal year 2021 was driven by a $111.4 million remeasurement adjustment related to the increase in the value of the incentive units as indicated by the Torrid Holding LLC equity value as of June 30, 2021, following the pricing of our IPO. 36 Fiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020 The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations for the periods indicated (dollars in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended January 29, 2022 % of Net Sales January 30, 2021 % of Net Sales Net sales (A) $ 1,297,271 100.0 % $ 984,170 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 759,826 58.6 % 643,215 65.4 % Gross profit 537,445 41.4 % 340,955 34.6 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (A) 439,409 33.8 % 232,754 23.6 % Marketing expenses 52,654 4.1 % 51,382 5.2 % Income from operations 45,382 3.5 % 56,819 5.8 % Interest expense 29,497 2.3 % 21,338 2.2 % Interest income, net of other expense (income) 56 0.0 % (42) 0.0 % Income before provision for income taxes 15,829 1.2 % 35,523 3.6 % Provision for income taxes 45,773 3.5 % 10,991 1.1 % Net (loss) income $ (29,944) (2.3) % $ 24,532 2.5 % (A) In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made a voluntary change in our accounting policy regarding the classification of PLCC Funds (as defined in "Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies") in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

(D) Other expenses include IPO related transaction fees and the reimbursement of certain management expenses, primarily for travel, incurred by Sycamore on our behalf, which are not considered to be part of our core business. Net Sales Net sales for fiscal year 2021 increased $313.1 million, or 31.8%, to $1,297.3 million, from $984.2 million for fiscal year 2020. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in orders placed and an increase in average order value relative to fiscal year 2020, which was impacted by disruption caused by the COVID 19 pandemic. Active customers increased 0.6 million, or 18.8%, to 3.8 million at the end of fiscal year 2021, from 3.2 million at the end of fiscal year 2020. Net sales per active customer increased by 10.0% from $309 in fiscal year 2020 to $340 in fiscal year 2021. The total number of stores we operate increased by 16 stores, or 2.6%, to 624 stores at the end of fiscal year 2021, from 608 stores at the end of fiscal year 2020. 37 Gross Profit Gross profit for fiscal year 2021 increased $196.5 million, or 57.6%, to $537.4 million, from $341.0 million for fiscal year 2020. This increase was primarily due to higher net sales volumes. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased 6.8% to 41.4% in fiscal year 2021 from 34.6% in fiscal year 2020. This increase was primarily driven by higher net sales volumes and leverage of store occupancy costs, distribution costs, merchandising payroll costs and store depreciation expense as a result of higher net sales volume. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2021 increased $206.7 million, or 88.8%, to $439.4 million, from $232.8 million for fiscal year 2020. This increase was primarily due to a $152.0 million increase in share based compensation expense, increased store payroll costs of $27.7 million, increased performance bonuses of $8.0 million, other store operating cost increases of $6.9 million and increased headquarters general and administrative expenses of $4.2 million, primarily due to additional costs associated with being a publicly traded company. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 10.2% to 33.8% in fiscal year 2021 from 23.6% in fiscal year 2020. This increase was driven by increased share based compensation expense and performance bonuses, partially offset by leverage of headquarters general and administrative expenses, other store operating costs and store/e Commerce payroll costs as a result of higher net sales volume. Marketing Expenses Marketing expenses for fiscal year 2021 increased $1.3 million, or 2.5%, to $52.7 million, from $51.4 million for fiscal year 2020. This increase was primarily due to increased digital, store and brand marketing, partially offset by decreased direct mail program spend. Marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased by 1.1% to 4.1% in fiscal year 2021 from 5.2% in fiscal year 2020. This decrease was driven by leverage of our marketing expenses as a result of higher net sales volume. Interest Expense Interest expense was $29.5 million for fiscal year 2021, compared to $21.3 million for fiscal year 2020. The increase was primarily due to the write off of $5.2 million of unamortized deferred financing costs and OID when we repaid the Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement, and the $2.1 million prepayment penalty. The increase was also due to an increase in the total borrowings outstanding related to the New Term Loan Credit Agreement as of January 29, 2022 compared to the total borrowings outstanding related to the Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement as of January 30, 2021, partially offset by a lower variable interest rate related to the New Term Loan Credit Agreement compared to the variable interest rate related to the Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement. Provision for Income Taxes The provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2021 increased by $34.8 million to $45.8 million, from $11.0 million for fiscal year 2020. Our effective tax rate was 289.2% for fiscal year 2021 as compared to 30.9% for fiscal year 2020. The unconventional effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to the increase in the amount of non deductible items associated with share based compensation, relative to income before provision for income taxes for fiscal year 2021. The increase in the amount of non deductible items associated with share based compensation during fiscal year 2021 was driven by a $111.4 million remeasurement adjustment related to the increase in the value of the incentive units as indicated by the Torrid Holding LLC equity value as of June 30, 2021, following the pricing of our IPO. 38 Quarterly Financial Data The following table summarizes our unaudited consolidated income (loss) from operations for each of the fiscal quarters in fiscal years 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands): Three Months Ended January 28, 2023 October 29, 2022 July 30, 2022 April 30, 2022 January 29, 2022 October 30, 2021 July 31, 2021 May 1, 2021 Net sales (A) $ 301,228 $ 300,201 $ 353,522 $ 333,193 $ 318,649 $ 310,890 $ 337,507 $ 330,225 Cost of goods sold 205,049 198,263 222,030 203,263 214,767 181,094 183,150 180,815 Gross profit 96,179 101,938 131,492 129,930 103,882 129,796 154,357 149,410 Selling, general and administrative expenses (A) 77,837 69,347 78,574 72,215 70,292 71,048 183,678 114,391 Marketing expenses 15,827 12,638 13,502 17,974 17,378 15,023 10,728 9,525 Income (loss) from operations 2,515 19,953 39,416 39,741 16,212 43,725 (40,049) 25,494 (A) In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made a voluntary change in our accounting policy regarding the classification of PLCC Funds (as defined in "Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies") in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The reclassification is applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented. See "Note 2Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" and "Note 21Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited)" for further information. Liquidity and Capital Resources General Our business relies on cash flows from operations as our primary source of liquidity. We do, however, have access to additional liquidity, if needed, through borrowings under our Existing ABL Facility, as amended. Our primary cash needs are for merchandise inventories, payroll, rent for our stores, headquarters and distribution center, capital expenditures associated with opening new stores and updating existing stores, logistics and information technology. We also need cash to fund our interest and principal payments on the New Term Loan Credit Agreement and make discretionary repurchases of our common stock. The most significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents, merchandise inventories, prepaid expenses and other current assets, accounts payable, accrued and other current liabilities and operating lease liabilities. We believe that cash generated from operations and the availability of borrowings under our Existing ABL Facility, as amended, or other financing arrangements will be sufficient to meet working capital requirements and anticipated capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months. There can be no assurance, however, that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available under our Existing ABL Facility, as amended, or otherwise to enable us to service our indebtedness, or to make capital expenditures in the future. Our future operating performance and our ability to service or extend our indebtedness will be subject to future economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Cash Flow Analysis A summary of operating, investing and financing activities are shown in the following table (dollars in thousands): Year Ended January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 January 30, 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 53,311 $ 121,220 $ 151,821 Net cash used in investing activities (23,369) (17,552) (11,570) Net cash used in financing activities (45,117) (197,809) (45,925) Net Cash Provided By Operating Activities Operating activities consist primarily of net income (loss) adjusted for noncash items, including depreciation and amortization and share based compensation, the effect of working capital changes and taxes paid. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2022 was $53.3 million compared to $121.2 million during fiscal year 2021. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2022 was primarily as a result of a decrease in share based compensation expense added back to cash provided by operating activities as a noncash adjustment and a decrease in accrued and other current liabilities, partially offset by the following activities during fiscal year 2022: (i) an 39 increase in net income, (ii) a decrease in prepaid income taxes and (iii) a decrease in inventory purchases. The decrease in share based compensation expense during fiscal year 2022 was due to an increase in Torrid Holding LLCs equity value during fiscal year 2021. The decrease in accrued and other current liabilities was primarily as a result of decreases in accrued payroll and related expenses and accrued inventory in transit. Net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year 2021 was $121.2 million compared to $151.8 million during fiscal year 2020. The decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily as a result of increases in inventory purchases and prepaid income taxes and decreases in net income (loss), operating lease liabilities and income taxes payable and a lower increase in accounts payable compared to fiscal year 2020. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was partially offset by a $152.0 million increase in share based compensation expense added back to net cash provided by operating activities as a noncash adjustment. The increase in share based compensation expense for fiscal year 2021 was due to an increase in Torrid Holding LLCs equity value combined with share based compensation pursuant to the Torrid Holdings Inc. 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan adopted on June 22, 2021. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities was also partially offset by an increase in accrued and other current liabilities related to increases in accrued inventory in transit and accrued payroll and related expenses and an increase in due to related parties. Net Cash Used In Investing Activities Typical investing activities consist primarily of capital expenditures for growth (new store openings, relocations and major remodels), store maintenance (minor store remodels and investments in store fixtures), and infrastructure to support the business related primarily to information technology, our headquarters facility and our West Jefferson, Ohio distribution center. Net cash used in investing activities were $23.4 million and $17.6 million in fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily as a result of an increase in capital expenditures related to the opening of new stores and store relocations and investments in our West Jefferson, Ohio distribution center during fiscal year 2022, compared to fiscal year 2021. Net cash used in investing activities were $17.6 million and $11.6 million in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily as a result of an increase in capital expenditures related to the opening of new stores, store relocations and investments in our West Jefferson, Ohio distribution center during fiscal year 2021, compared to fiscal year 2020. Net Cash Used In Financing Activities Financing activities consist primarily of (i) borrowings and repayments related to our Existing ABL Facility, as amended, (ii) borrowings and repayments related to the New Term Loan Credit Agreement and (iii) repurchases and retirement of our common stock. Net cash used in financing activities were $45.1 million and $197.8 million for fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities is primarily as a result of the following activities during fiscal year 2022: (i) the absence of the $300.0 million capital distribution to Torrid Holding LLC, (ii) the absence of the $212.8 million repayment of the Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement and related costs and (iii) $8.4 million net borrowing from the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, partially offset by repurchases and retirement of common stock of $31.7 million, principal payments of $21.9 million on the New Term Loan Credit Agreement and the absence of the $340.5 million proceeds received during fiscal year 2021 from the New Term Loan Credit agreement. Net cash used in financing activities was $197.8 million for fiscal year 2021 compared to $45.9 million for fiscal year 2020. The increase in net cash used in financing activities is primarily as a result of the following activities during fiscal year 2021: (i) $300.0 million distribution to Torrid Holding LLC, (ii) principal payments on the Amended Term Loan Credit agreement of $210.7 million, (iii) $2.1 million prepayment penalty related to the Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement, (iv) tax payments of $2.1 million made on behalf of our employees related to the vesting of restricted stock awards and RSUs, (v) $0.7 million of deferred financing costs related to the 3rd Amendment to the Existing ABL Facility, as amended and (vi) $23.4 million for repurchases and retirement of common stock, partially offset by proceeds from the New Term Loan Credit Agreement of $340.5 million, net of OID and deferred financing costs and proceeds of $0.6 million for issuances under share based compensation plans. 40 Debt Financing Arrangements For the stated periods, our debt financing arrangements consisted of the following (in thousands): January 28, 2023 January 29, 2022 Existing ABL Facility, as amended $ 8,380 $ Term loan New Term Loan Credit Agreement 328,125 350,000 Less: current portion of unamortized original issue discount and debt financing costs (1,356) (1,356) Less: noncurrent portion of unamortized original issue discount and debt financing costs (5,928) (7,284) Total term loan outstanding, net of unamortized original issue discount and debt financing costs 320,841 341,360 Less: current portion of term loan, net of unamortized original issue discount and debt financing costs (16,144) (20,519) Total term loan, net of current portion and unamortized original issue discount and debt financing costs $ 304,697 $ 320,841 New Term Loan Credit Agreement On June 14, 2021, we entered into a term loan credit agreement ("New Term Loan Credit Agreement") among Bank of America, N.A., as agent, and the lenders party thereto. The New Term Loan Credit Agreement provides for term loans in an initial aggregate amount of $350.0 million ("Principal"), which is recorded net of OID of $3.5 million and has a maturity date of June 14, 2028. In connection with the New Term Loan Credit Agreement, we paid financing costs of approximately $6.0 million. The $346.5 million proceeds of the New Term Loan Credit Agreement, net of OID, were used to (i) repay and terminate the Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement (as defined below); (ii) make a $131.7 million distribution to the direct and indirect holders of our equity interests; and (iii) pay for financing costs associated with the New Term Loan Credit Agreement. Loans made pursuant to the New Term Loan Credit Agreement bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate quoted by The Wall Street Journal, (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (3) a LIBOR rate for an interest period of one month, plus 1.00% (in each case, subject to a floor of 1.75%); or (b) at a LIBOR rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing (subject to a floor of 0.75%), in each case plus an applicable margin of 5.50% for LIBOR borrowings and 4.50% for base rate borrowings. If we elect the LIBOR rate, interest is due and payable on the last day of each interest period, unless an interest period exceeds three months, then the respective dates that fall every three months after the beginning of the interest period shall also be interest payment dates. If we elect the Base rate loan, interest is due and payable the last day of each calendar quarter. The elected interest rate at the end of fiscal year 2022 was approximately 10%. In addition to paying interest on the outstanding Principal under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement, we are required to make fixed mandatory repayments of the Principal on the last business day of each fiscal quarter until maturity commencing with the second full fiscal quarter following the closing date ("Repayment"). For each of the fiscal quarters until the maturity date and starting with the fourth fiscal quarter of 2021, Repayments represent 1.25% of the Principal, reduced as a result of the application of prior Prepayments (as defined below). Under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement, we are also required to make variable mandatory prepayments of the Principal, under certain conditions as described below, approximately 102 days after the end of each fiscal year (each, a "Prepayment"). Prepayments, if applicable, commence at the end of fiscal year 2022 and represent between 0% and 50% (depending on our first lien net leverage ratio) of Excess Cash Flow (as defined in the New Term Loan Credit Agreement) in excess of $10.0 million, minus prepayments of Principal, the Existing ABL Facility, as amended (to the extent accompanied by a permanent reduction in the commitments thereunder) and certain other specified indebtedness and amounts in connection with certain other enumerated items. As of January 28, 2023, we did not meet the Excess Cash Flow threshold to require a Prepayment. 41 In addition to mandatory Repayment and Prepayment obligations, we may at our option, prepay a portion of the outstanding Principal ("Optional Prepayment"). If we make Optional Prepayments before June 14, 2023, we will be subject to penalties ranging from 1.00% to 2.00% of the aggregate principal amount. All of Torrid LLCs existing domestic subsidiaries and Torrid Intermediate LLC unconditionally guarantee all obligations under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement. Substantially all of the assets of Torrid LLC, Torrid LLCs existing subsidiaries and Torrid Intermediate LLC will secure all such obligations and the guarantees of those obligations, subject to certain exceptions. The New Term Loan Credit Agreement also contains a number of covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, will restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: create, incur or assume liens on our assets or property; incur additional indebtedness; issue preferred or disqualified stock; consolidate or merge; sell assets; pay dividends or make distributions, make investments, or engage in transactions with our affiliates. At the end of fiscal year 2022, we were compliant with our financial covenants under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement. At the end of fiscal year 2022, the fair value of the New Term Loan Credit Agreement was approximately $267.4 million. The fair value of the New Term Loan Credit Agreement is determined using current applicable rates for similar instruments as of the balance sheet date, a Level 2 measurement (as defined in "Note 20Fair Value Measurements"). At the end of fiscal year 2022, total borrowings, net of OID and financing costs, of $320.8 million remain outstanding under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement. During fiscal year 2022, we recognized $26.3 million of interest expense and $1.4 million OID and financing costs related to the New Term Loan Credit Agreement. The OID and financing costs are amortized over the New Term Loan Credit Agreements seven year term and are reflected as a direct deduction of the face amount of the term loan in our consolidated balance sheets. We recognize interest payments, together with amortization of the OID and financing costs, in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Senior Secured Asset Based Revolving Credit Facility In May 2015, we entered into a credit agreement for a senior secured asset based revolving credit facility ("Original ABL Facility") of $50.0 million (subject to a borrowing base), with Bank of America, N.A. On October 23, 2017, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement ("Existing ABL Facility"), which amended our Original ABL Facility. The Existing ABL Facility increased the aggregate commitments available under the Original ABL Facility from $50.0 million to $100.0 million (subject to a borrowing base); and increased our right to request additional commitments from up to $30.0 million to up to $30.0 million plus the aggregate principal amount of any permanent principal reductions we may take (subject to customary conditions precedent). On June 14, 2019, in conjunction with the Term Loan Credit Agreement, we entered into an amendment to the Existing ABL Facility (the "1st Amendment"). The 1st Amendment decreased the aggregate commitments available under the Existing ABL Facility from $100.0 million to $70.0 million (subject to a borrowing base), permitted indebtedness incurred pursuant to the Term Loan Credit Agreement and made certain other modifications. On September 4, 2019, we entered into another amendment to the Existing ABL Facility (the "2nd Amendment"). The 2nd Amendment permitted parent company financial statements to be used to satisfy reporting requirements and made certain other modifications. On June 14, 2021, in conjunction with the New Term Loan Credit Agreement, we entered into a third amendment to the Existing ABL Facility (the "3rd Amendment"), which amended our Existing ABL Facility, as amended. The 3rd Amendment increased the aggregate commitments available under the Existing ABL facility, as amended, from $70.0 million to $150.0 million (subject to a borrowing base) and extended the date upon which the principal amount outstanding of the loans would be due and payable in full from October 23, 2022 to June 14, 2026. All other material terms of the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, remain substantially the same as the previous agreements it replaced. The borrowing base for the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, at any time equals the sum of 90% of eligible credit card receivables, plus 90% of the appraised net orderly liquidation value of eligible inventory and eligible in transit inventory multiplied by the cost of such eligible inventory and eligible in transit inventory (to be increased to 92.5% during the period beginning on September 1 of each year and ending on December 31 of each year). The Existing ABL Facility, as amended, includes borrowing capacity for letters of credit and for borrowings on same day notice, referred to as Swing Line Loans, and is available in U.S. dollars. Under the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, we have the right to request up to $50.0 million of additional commitments plus the aggregate principal amount of any permanent principal reductions we may take plus the amount by which the borrowing base exceeds the aggregate commitments (subject to customary conditions precedent). The lenders under this facility 42 are not under any obligation to provide any such additional commitments, and any increase in commitments is subject to customary conditions precedent. If we were to request any such additional commitments and the existing lenders or new lenders were to agree to provide such commitments, the size of the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, could increase to up to $200.0 million, but our ability to borrow under this facility would still be limited by the amount of the borrowing base. Borrowings under the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at our option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the highest of (1) the prime rate of Bank of America, N.A., (2) the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and (3) a LIBOR rate for an interest period of one month adjusted for certain costs, plus 1.00%, in each case, plus an applicable margin that ranges from 0.25% to 0.75% based on average daily availability; or (b) at a LIBOR rate for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain costs ("Adjusted LIBOR"), in each case plus an applicable margin that ranges from 1.25% to 1.75%, based on average daily availability. At the end of fiscal year 2022, the applicable interest rate for borrowings under the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, was approximately 8% per annum. If we elect the LIBOR rate, interest is due and payable on the last day of each interest period, unless an interest period exceeds three months, then the respective dates that fall every three months after the beginning of the interest period shall also be interest payment dates. If we opt for the base rate (including a Swing Line Loan), interest is due and payable on the first business day of each month and on the maturity date. In addition to paying interest on outstanding principal under the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, we are required to pay a commitment fee in respect of unutilized commitments. The commitment fee ranges between 0.25% and 0.375% per annum of unutilized commitments and will be subject to adjustment each fiscal quarter based on the amount of unutilized commitments during the immediately preceding fiscal quarter. We must also pay customary letter of credit fees and agent fees. If at any time the aggregate amount of outstanding loans, unreimbursed letter of credit drawings and undrawn letters of credit under the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, exceeds the lesser of (a) the commitment amount and (b) the borrowing base, we will be required to repay outstanding loans and or cash collateralize letters of credit in an aggregate amount equal to such excess, with no reduction of the commitment amount. We may voluntarily reduce the unused portion of the commitment amount and repay outstanding loans at any time. Prepayment of the loans may be made without premium or penalty other than customary breakage costs with respect to LIBOR loans. All obligations under the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, are unconditionally guaranteed by substantially all of Torrid Intermediate LLCs existing majority owned domestic subsidiaries and will be required to be guaranteed by certain of Torrid Intermediate LLCs future domestic majority owned subsidiaries. All obligations under the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, and the guarantees of those obligations, will be secured, subject to certain exceptions, by substantially all of Torrid Intermediate LLCs assets. The Existing ABL Facility, as amended, requires us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of at least 1.00 to 1.00 if we fail to maintain Specified Availability (as defined by the Existing ABL Facility, as amended) of at least the greater of 10% of the Loan Cap, as defined by the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, and $7.0 million. The Existing ABL Facility, as amended, contains a number of other covenants that, among other things and subject to certain exceptions, will restrict our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or our other indebtedness; make investments, loans and acquisitions; engage in transactions with our affiliates; sell assets, including capital stock of our subsidiaries; alter the business we conduct; consolidate or merge; and incur liens. At the end of fiscal year 2022, we were compliant with our debt covenants under the Existing ABL Facility, as amended. The Existing ABL Facility, as amended, specifically restricts dividends and distributions, aside from amounts to cover ordinary operating expenses and taxes, between our subsidiaries and to us. However, dividends and distributions are permitted at any time that either (1) availability under the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, is equal to or greater than 15% of the maximum borrowing amount on a pro forma basis and we are pro forma compliant with a 1.00 to 1.00 fixed charge coverage ratio or (2) availability under the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, is equal to or greater than 20% of the maximum borrowing amount on a pro forma basis. At the end of fiscal year 2022, the maximum restricted payment utilizing the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, that our subsidiaries could make from its net assets was $127.5 million. We consider the carrying amounts of the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, to approximate fair value because it is carried at a market observable interest rate that resets periodically and is categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 43 Availability under the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, at the end of fiscal year 2022 was $134.2 million, which reflects borrowings of $8.4 million. Availability under the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, at the end of fiscal year 2022 was $123.9 million, which reflects no borrowings. Standby letters of credit issued and outstanding were $7.4 million and $5.3 million at the end of fiscal years 2022 and 2021, respectively. During the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, we incurred $0.5 million of financing costs for the Existing ABL Facility, which were reduced in fiscal year 2019 by $0.1 million written off to account for the impact of our entry into the 1st Amendment. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we incurred an additional $0.7 million of financing costs in connection with our entry into the 3rd Amendment. These financing costs, together with the unamortized financing costs of $0.1 million associated with the Original ABL Facility, are amortized over the five year term of the Existing ABL Facility, as amended, and are reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets and deposits and other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheets. During fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, we amortized financing costs of $0.2 million, $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively. During fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020, interest payments were $1.8 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million, respectively. We recognize amortization of financing costs and interest payments for the revolving credit facilities in interest expense in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). Share Repurchases On December 6, 2021, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we may purchase up to $100.0 million of our outstanding common stock. Repurchases may be made from time to time, depending upon a variety of factors, including share price, corporate and regulatory requirements, and other market and business conditions, as determined by us. We may purchase shares of our common stock in the open market at current market prices at the time of purchase, in privately negotiated transactions, or by other means. The authorization does not, however, obligate us to acquire any particular amount of shares, and the share repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time at our discretion. As of January 28, 2023, we had approximately $44.9 million remaining under the repurchase program. Contractual Obligations We enter into long term contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business, primarily debt obligations, purchase obligations and non cancelable operating leases. As of January 28, 2023, our contractual cash obligations over the next several periods are set forth below (dollars in thousands). Payments Due by Period Total LT1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Thereafter Contractual Obligations: New Term Loan Credit Agreement Obligations (1) $ 328,125 $ 17,500 $ 35,000 $ 35,000 $ 240,625 Interest Expense on New Term Loan Credit Agreement Obligations (1)(2) 158,682 33,536 61,597 54,297 9,252 Purchase Obligations 209,998 209,998 Letters of Credit and Other Obligations (3) 36,962 27,217 9,745 Operating Lease Obligations (4) 257,350 56,665 100,724 57,147 42,814 Total $ 991,117 $ 344,916 $ 207,066 $ 146,444 $ 292,691 (1) Amounts assume that the New Term Loan Credit Agreement is paid upon maturity and does not consider any variable mandatory principal prepayments or optional principal prepayments which we may make in the future. (2) Assumes an interest rate of approximately 10% per annum, consistent with the interest rate at January 28, 2023. (3) Amounts listed above do not include cash obligations related to relocation expenses in connection with the involuntary separation of certain employees due to the uncertainty regarding the amount of such expenses. (4) Includes estimated annual future minimum occupancy payments under operating leases including minimum base rents, common area maintenance charges and heating, ventilation and cooling charges, for lease terms that include periods covered by options to extend some of our leases, as we are reasonably certain to exercise those options. Options to terminate our leases have not been included in any lease terms as we are not reasonably certain to exercise those options. See "Note 9Leases" contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes, included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional disclosure related to operating lease obligations. We have not included any income tax audit settlement payments due in less than one year in the contractual obligations table above as we do not have any open income tax audits as of January 28, 2023 or any material gross unrecognized tax benefits for which the statutes of limitations are expected to expire in fiscal year 2023. In addition, due to the uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows associated with noncurrent unrecognized tax benefits of $3.3 million, we are unable to make a reliable estimate of the periods of cash settlement with the respective tax authorities and have not included such amounts in the contractual obligations table above. 44 Critical Accounting Estimates Our discussion of results of operations and financial condition is based upon the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and certain assumptions about future events that affect the classification and amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes, including revenue and expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. These estimates and assumptions are based on our historical results as well as managements judgment. Although management believes the judgment applied in preparing estimates is reasonable based on circumstances and information known at the time, actual results could vary materially from estimates based on assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. The most significant accounting estimates involve a high degree of judgment or complexity. Management believes the estimates and judgments most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and to the understanding of our reported financial results include those made in connection with revenue recognition, including accounting for estimated merchandise returns and loyalty program expenses; estimating the value of inventory; determining operating lease liabilities; and estimating share based compensation expense. Management evaluates its policies and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our significant accounting estimates related to these accounts in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described below (see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for additional information regarding our critical accounting policies). Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when our performance obligations under the terms of a contract or an implied arrangement with a customer are satisfied, which is when the merchandise is transferred to the customer and the customer obtains control of it. The amount of revenue we recognize reflects the total consideration we expect to receive for the merchandise, which is the transaction price. For arrangements that contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative stand alone selling price basis. At our retail store locations, we satisfy our performance obligation and recognize revenue at the point in time when a customer takes possession of the merchandise and tenders payment at the point of sale register. For e Commerce sales shipped to a customer from our distribution center, or from a retail store location (ship from store), we satisfy our performance obligation and recognize revenue upon shipment, which is the point in time the customer obtains control of the merchandise after payment has been tendered. Income we receive from customers for shipping and handling is recognized as a component of revenue upon shipment of merchandise to the customer. We satisfy our performance obligation and recognize revenue from e Commerce sales shipped to a retail store location from our distribution center, or fulfilled from merchandise already located at a retail store location (buy online pickup in store), at the point in time when the customer retrieves the merchandise from within the retail store location or at a retail store curbside. We are required to estimate certain amounts included in a contract or an implied arrangement with a customer which add variability to the transaction price. Under certain conditions, we are obligated to accept customer returns for most of our merchandise. Sales returns reduce the revenue we expect to receive for merchandise and therefore add variability to the transaction price. Based on historical return pattern experience, we reasonably estimate the amount of merchandise expected to be returned and exclude it from revenue. We record a reserve for merchandise returns at the time revenue is recognized based on prior returns experience and expected future returns in accordance with our return policy and discretionary returns practices. We monitor our returns experience and resulting reserves on an ongoing basis and we believe our estimates are reasonable. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the assumptions used to calculate the allowance for sales returns. However, if actual sales returns are significantly different than the estimated allowance, our results of operations could be materially affected. We satisfy our performance obligation and recognize revenue from gift cards and store merchandise credits at the point in time when the customer presents the gift cards and store merchandise credits for redemption. Gift card breakage is income recognized due to the non redemption of a portion of gift cards sold by us for which a liability was recorded in prior periods. We recognize estimated gift card breakage over time as a component of net sales in proportion to the pattern of rights exercised by the customer as reflected in actual gift card redemption patterns over the period. Based upon historical experience, we estimate the value of outstanding gift cards that will ultimately not be redeemed (breakage) nor escheated under statutory unclaimed property laws. This amount is recognized as revenue over the time pattern established by our historical gift card redemption experience. We monitor our gift card redemption experience and associated accounting on an ongoing basis. Our historical gift card redemption experience has not varied significantly from amounts historically recorded as breakage and we believe our assumptions are reasonable. While customer redemption patterns result in estimated gift card breakage, changes in 45 our customers behavior could impact the amount that ultimately is unused and could affect the amount recognized as a component of net sales. If a customer earns loyalty program points in connection with the sales transactions described above, then we have a remaining performance obligation and cannot recognize all the revenue. A portion of the revenue is allocated to the loyalty program points earned during the transaction. We satisfy our performance obligation and recognize revenue allocated to these loyalty program points and the resulting awards at the point in time when the awards are redeemed for merchandise, when we determine that they will not be redeemed, or when the awards and points expire. Under our loyalty program, customers accumulate points based on purchase activity and qualifying non purchase activity. Upon reaching a certain point level, customers can earn awards that may only be redeemed for merchandise. Unredeemed points typically expire after 13 months without additional purchase activity and qualifying non purchase activity. Unredeemed awards typically expire 45 days after issuance. We use historical redemption rates to estimate the value of future award redemptions and we recognize the estimated value of these future awards as a reduction of revenue in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the period the points are earned by the customer. Inventory Inventory consists of finished goods merchandise held for sale to our customers. Inventory is valued at the lower of moving average cost or net realizable value. In the normal course of business, we record inventory reserves based on past and projected sales performance, as well as the inventory on hand. We make certain assumptions regarding net realizable value in order to assess whether our inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or net realizable value. These assumptions are based on both historical average selling price experience, current selling price information and estimated future selling price information. The carrying value of inventory is reduced to estimated net realizable value when factors indicate that merchandise will not be sold on terms sufficient to recover its cost. We monitor inventory levels, sales trends and sales forecasts to estimate and record reserves for excess, slow moving and obsolete inventory. Accordingly, estimates of future sales prices requires management judgment based on historical experience, assessment of current conditions and assumptions about future transactions. In addition, we conduct physical inventory counts to determine and record actual shrinkage. Estimates for shrinkage are recorded between physical counts, based on actual shrinkage experience. Actual shrinkage can vary from these estimates. We believe our assumptions are reasonable, and we monitor actual results to adjust estimates and inventory balances on an ongoing basis. Leases We consider an agreement to be or contain a lease if it conveys us with the right to control the use of an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Based on these criteria, we have operating lease agreements for our retail stores, distribution center and headquarter office space; and vehicles and equipment; under primarily non cancelable leases with terms ranging from approximately two to seventeen years. Certain of our operating lease agreements contain one or more options to extend the leases at our sole discretion. However, the periods covered by the options to extend the leases of our retail stores, vehicles and equipment are not recognized as part of the associated right of use ("ROU") assets and lease liabilities, as we are not reasonably certain to exercise the options. The periods covered by the options to extend the leases of our distribution center and headquarter office space are recognized as part of the associated ROU assets and lease liabilities, as we are reasonably certain to exercise the options. Some of our operating lease agreements contain options to terminate the lease under certain conditions. The retail space leases provide for rents based upon the greater of the minimum annual rental amounts or a percentage of annual store net sales volume. Certain leases provide for increasing minimum annual rental amounts. We consider rents based upon a percentage of annual store net sales volume, and other rent related payments that generally vary because of changes in facts and circumstances (other than due to the passage of time), to be variable lease payments. Variable lease payments associated with retail space leases are recognized as occupancy costs within cost of goods sold in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred. We generally consider all other lease payments to be fixed in nature and the sum of all the discounted remaining fixed payments in the lease terms make up the lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet (if the lease terms are longer than 12 months). We discount the fixed lease payments that make up the lease liabilities using an incremental borrowing rate ("IBR"), as the rates implicit in our leases are not readily determinable. The IBR is the rate of interest that we would have to pay to borrow 46 on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments in a similar economic environment. The determination of the IBR for each lease term incorporates various inputs and assumptions including our publicly available credit rating, credit spreads of other publicly traded debt issued by companies with a similar credit rating to ours and a risk free interest rate. All inputs and assumptions and corresponding IBRs are highly subjective. We choose not to separate nonlease components (such as common area maintenance charges and heating, ventilation and air conditioning charges), from lease components (such as fixed minimum rent payments), and instead account for each separate lease component and the nonlease components associated with that lease component as a single lease component. We do not apply ASU 2016 02, Leases , and all related guidance ("ASC 842") requirements to leases that have lease terms of 12 months or less upon commencement, and instead recognize short term lease payments, if applicable, in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss) on a straight line basis over the lease term. In response to the COVID 19 pandemic, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued interpretive guidance in April 2020, which provides entities the option to elect to account for lease concessions as though the enforceable rights and obligations existed in the original lease terms. We elected this option; accordingly, we did not remeasure the lease liabilities or record a change to the ROU assets for any concessions we received for our retail store leases. Rather, deferred lease payments were recorded to operating lease liabilities until paid and lease concessions were recorded in the period they were negotiated or when the lower lease expense was paid. Share Based Compensation On June 22, 2021, in connection with our IPO, our board of directors adopted the Torrid Holdings Inc. 2021 Long Term Incentive Plan (the "2021 LTIP"), for employees, consultants and directors. The 2021 LTIP provides for the grant of non qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and restricted stock units ("RSUs") including performance based restricted stock units ("PSUs"), stock awards, dividend equivalents, other stock based awards, cash awards and substitute awards intended to align the interests of service providers, with those of our shareholders, all of which are accounted for in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation Stock Compensation . The Company measures share based compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognizes share based compensation cost as expense over the vesting period. As share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest, the amount of expense has been reduced for actual forfeitures as they occur. Stock options are valued utilizing a Black Scholes options pricing model ("OPM"). The OPM used to value the stock options incorporates various assumptions, including dividend yield, expected volatility, risk free interest rate and expected term of the stock options. The expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of a select peer group of similar publicly traded companies for a term that is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The risk free interest rates are based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected term of the stock options. The expected term of the stock options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is calculated using the simplified method which deems the term to be the average of the time to vesting and the contractual life of the options. The grant date fair value of restricted stock and RSUs is based on the closing price per share of our common stock on the grant date. We recognize compensation expense for time based awards on a straight line basis and for performance based awards on the graded vesting method over the vesting period of the awards. The fair value of PSUs is estimated at the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation following a Geometric Brownian Motion which incorporates various assumptions, including dividend yield, expected volatility, risk free interest rate and expected term of the PSUs. The expected volatility is estimated based on the historical volatility of a select peer group of similar publicly traded companies for a term that is consistent with the expected term of the PSUs. The risk free interest rates are based on the U.S. Treasury constant maturity interest rate whose term is consistent with the expected term of the PSUs. The expected term of the PSUs represents the time period from the grant date and the full vesting date. Prior to our IPO, Torrid Holding LLC issued 13,660,000 Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D, Class E, Class F, Class G, Class H and Class J Torrid incentive units, in the aggregate, net of forfeitures, to certain members of our management. These incentive units were intended to constitute profits interests. We recognized the impact of share based compensation associated with incentive units issued by Torrid Holding LLC in selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss). The share based compensation expense and related capital contribution are reflected in our consolidated financial statements as these awards were deemed to be for our benefit. The intent of the incentive units was to provide profit sharing opportunities to management rather than equity ownership in our then parent, Torrid Holding LLC. The incentive units did not have any voting 47 or distribution rights and contained a repurchase feature, whereby upon termination, Torrid Holding LLC had the right to purchase from former employees any or all of the vested incentive units at fair value. In addition, although the fair value of the incentive units was determined through an option pricing methodology that utilized the possible equity values of Torrid Holding LLC, the settlement amounts and method of settlement of the incentive units were at the discretion of our board of directors. Based on these aforementioned features and characteristics, we determined that the incentive units were in substance liabilities accounted for as liability instruments in accordance with ASC 710, Compensatio n. The incentive units were remeasured based on the fair value of the awards at the end of each reporting period. We recorded the expense associated with changes in the fair value of these incentive units as a capital contribution from our former parent, Torrid Holding LLC, as our former parent was the legal obligor for the incentive units. The incentive units were valued utilizing a contingent claims analysis ("CCA") methodology based on a Black Scholes OPM. Under the OPM, each class of incentive units was modeled as a call option with a unique claim on the assets of Torrid Holding LLC. The characteristics of each class of incentive units determined the uniqueness of the claim on the assets of Torrid Holding LLC. The OPM used to value the incentive units incorporated various assumptions, including the time to liquidity event, equity volatility and risk free interest rate of return. Equity volatility was based on the historical volatilities of comparable publicly traded companies for the time horizon equal to the time to the anticipated liquidity event; and the risk free interest rate was for a term corresponding to the time to liquidity event. The assumptions underlying the valuation of the incentive units represented our best estimates, which involved inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment. The most recent remeasurement of the fair value of the incentive units utilizing the CCA methodology was performed as of May 1, 2021. Following the pricing of our IPO, the vested portion of the incentive units was exchanged for shares of our common stock of an equivalent fair value as the vested incentive units and the unvested portion was cancelled. As such, the fair value of these incentive units is no longer recognized in our consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income (loss).

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We are subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under our Existing ABL Facility, as amended, and New Term Loan Credit Agreement, which bear interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin. On June 14, 2021, we entered into the New Term Loan Credit Agreement and used borrowings thereunder to, among other things, repay and terminate the Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement. Prior to June 14, 2021 we were subject to interest rate risk in connection with borrowings under the Amended Term Loan Credit Agreement, which bore interest at a variable rate equal to LIBOR plus an applicable margin. As of January 28, 2023, we had $320.8 million of outstanding variable rate loans under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement and $8.4 million of borrowings under the Existing ABL Facility, as amended. An increase or decrease of 1% in the variable rates on the amount outstanding under the New Term Loan Credit Agreement will increase or decrease our annual interest expense by approximately $3.3 million. Foreign Exchange Risk The reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is U.S. dollars. To date, net sales generated outside of the United States have not been significant. As a result, we have not been impacted materially by changes in exchange rates and do not expect to be impacted materially for the foreseeable future. However, as our net sales generated outside of the United States increase, our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in exchange rates. For example, if we recognize international sales in local foreign currencies (as we currently do in Canada), as the U.S. dollar strengthens it would have a negative impact on our international results upon translation of those results into U.S. dollars during consolidation. We also purchase a significant quantity of merchandise from foreign countries. However, these purchases are made in U.S. dollar denominated purchase contracts. We do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations and do not intend to do so for the foreseeable future. 48
